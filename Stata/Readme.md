**Notes on Stata ado programme**: To install the ado file in Stata, just type 'ssc install ABRS'. In case Stata cannot connect to the internet, you may also manually copy both files (`abrsqol.ado`, `abrsqol.sthlp`) to your ado folder. The programme will be ready to use. For information on the syntax, type 'help ABRS'.

## Ready-to-use script

If you are new to Stata, you may find it useful to execute the `Example.do` script saved in this folder. It will install the package, load the testing data set, generate a quality-of-life index, and save it to your working directory.  It should be straightforward to adapt the script to your data and preferred parameter values.
