Description: This toolkit implements a numerical solution algorithm to invert a quality of life (QoL) from observed data in various programming languages. The QoL measure is based on Ahlfeldt, Bald, Roth, Seidel (2024): Measuring quality of life under spatial frictions. Unlike the traditional Rosen-Roback measure, this measure accounts for mobility frictions—generated by idiosyncratic tastes and local ties—and trade frictions—generated by trade costs and non-tradable services, thereby reducing non-classical measurement error. When using this programme or the toolkit in your work, please cite the paper.
