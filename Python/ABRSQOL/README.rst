    Numerical solution algorithm to invert a quality of life measure


This toolkit implements a numerical solution algorithm
to invert a quality of life (QoL) from observed data
in various programming languages. The QoL measure is
based on Ahlfeldt, Bald, Roth, Seidel (2024):
Measuring quality of life under spatial frictions.
Unlike the traditional Rosen-Roback measure, this measure
accounts for mobility frictions—generated by idiosyncratic
tastes and local ties—and trade frictions—generated by
trade costs and non-tradable services, thereby reducing
non-classical measurement error.
When using this programme or the toolkit in your work, please cite the paper.

Notice that quality of life is identified up to a constant.
Therefore, the inverted QoL measures measure has a relative
interpretation only. We normalize the QoL relative to the first
observation in the data set. It is straightforward to rescale
the QoL measure to any other location or any other value (such
as the mean or median in the distribution of QoL across locations).
